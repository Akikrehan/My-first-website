    <p>2. Robert Herrick, ‘To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time’.

        The seventeenth century was the age of the carpe diem poem, where poets implored young people to make the most of time, before time made dead bodies of them. This poem from Robert Herrick (1591-1674) is one of the best examples of such a poem about fickle time:
        
        Then be not coy, but use your time,
        And while ye may, go marry;
        For having lost but once your prime,
        You may forever tarry …
        
        
        Don’t tarry or waste time: you get just one life, so grasp the nettle and make the most of it. In his poem ‘To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time’ – often known by that ‘Gather ye rosebuds’ first line – Robert Herrick brilliantly captures the ‘seize the day’ sentiment.
